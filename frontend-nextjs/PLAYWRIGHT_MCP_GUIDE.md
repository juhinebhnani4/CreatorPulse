# Playwright MCP for E2E Testing Guide

## Overview

Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows you to interact with Playwright directly through Claude Code, enabling AI-powered browser automation and E2E testing. The Playwright MCP server is already configured in your Claude settings and ready to use.

## What is Playwright MCP?

Playwright MCP provides tools that let Claude Code:
- Navigate web pages and interact with elements
- Take screenshots and videos
- Fill forms and click buttons
- Verify page content and state
- Debug failing tests
- Generate test code from descriptions

## Configuration Status

âœ… **Already Configured**: Playwright MCP is set up in your Claude config at:
```
C:\Users\Jyotsna\.claude\config.json
```

```json
"Playwright": {
  "command": "npx @playwright/mcp@latest"
}
```

## Available MCP Tools

When you request E2E testing through Claude Code, the following Playwright MCP tools are automatically available:

### 1. `playwright_navigate`
Navigate to a URL in the browser
```
Usage: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. `playwright_screenshot`
Take a screenshot of the current page
```
Usage: Take a screenshot of the current page
```

### 3. `playwright_click`

```

## How to Use Playwright MCP

### Method 1: Natural Language Testing (Recommended)

Simply describe what you want to test, and Claude will use the Playwright MCP tools automatically:

**Example requests:**
```
"Test the login flow on localhost:3000"
"Navigate to the dashboard and take a screenshot"
"Check if the signup form validates email correctly"
"Fill out the workspace creation form and verify it saves"
```

### Method 2: Direct Test Execution

Ask Claude to run your existing Playwright tests using MCP for enhanced debugging:

```
"Run the user onboarding test and debug any failures"
"Execute journey-1 test and show screenshots at each step"
```

### Method 3: Test Generation

Describe a user journey and Claude will generate the test code:

```
"Generate a test for: user signs up, creates workspace, adds RSS source"
```

## Example Use Cases

## Integration with Your Existing Tests

Your project already has comprehensive E2E tests. Here's how Playwright MCP enhances them:

### Existing Test Files:
- [journey-1-user-onboarding.spec.ts](frontend-nextjs/e2e/journey-1-user-onboarding.spec.ts)
- [journey-2-content-sources.spec.ts](frontend-nextjs/e2e/journey-2-content-sources.spec.ts)
- [journey-3-newsletter-generation.spec.ts](frontend-nextjs/e2e/journey-3-newsletter-generation.spec.ts)

### How MCP Enhances These Tests:

1. **Interactive Debugging**: When tests fail, ask Claude to debug using MCP
2. **Visual Verification**: Get screenshots at any point without writing code
3. **Quick Checks**: Test specific scenarios without running full test suite
4. **Test Generation**: Create new tests by describing behavior

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Quick Login Test

**You say:**
```
"Use Playwright MCP to test the login flow with email: test@example.com"
```

**Claude will:**
```
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Fill email field: "test@example.com"
3. Fill password field: "password123"
4. Click "Sign In" button
5. Verify redirect to dashboard
6. Take screenshot of result
```

### Example 2: Debug Failing Test

**You say:**
```
"Journey 1 test is failing at step 4. Use MCP to navigate there and show me what's happening"
```

**Claude will:**
1. Navigate to the point of failure
2. Take screenshot
3. Check console logs
4. Inspect element states
5. Identify the issue

### Example 3: Create New Test

**You say:**
```
"Generate a test for editing workspace settings using Playwright MCP"
```

**Claude will:**
1. Explore the settings page using MCP
2. Identify form elements
3. Generate test code
4. Run test to verify it works

## Combining Playwright MCP with Supabase MCP

You have both Playwright and Supabase MCP configured. This powerful combination allows:

**Frontend + Backend Verification:**
```
You: "Test workspace creation and verify it in the database"

Claude will:
1. Use Playwright MCP to create workspace in UI
2. Use Supabase MCP to verify record in database
3. Confirm data integrity
```

## Running Your Existing Tests with MCP Benefits

### Standard Test Run (without MCP)
```bash
cd frontend-nextjs
npm run test:e2e
```

### Enhanced Test Run (with MCP via Claude)

**You say to Claude:**
```
"Run the E2E tests and help debug any failures using Playwright MCP"
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic debugging on failures
- Screenshots at failure points
- Console log analysis
- Suggested fixes
- Interactive troubleshooting

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Feature Testing
```
1. You: "I added a new feature for bulk content deletion"

3. Claude: Uses MCP to explore UI and generates test
4. You: "Run the test"
5. Claude: Executes and reports results
```

### Workflow 2: Bug Investigation
```
1. You: "Users report login button not working"
2. You: "Use Playwright MCP to test login on localhost:3000"
3. Claude: Navigates, tests, takes screenshots
4. Claude: Identifies issue (e.g., button disabled due to validation)
5. Claude: Suggests fix
```

### Workflow 3: Visual Verification
```
1. You: "Compare dashboard layout before and after my changes"
2. You: "Take screenshot of /dashboard"
3. Claude: Captures current state
4. You: "Compare with screenshot from last week"
5. Claude: Identifies visual differences
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Servers First
Always ensure both frontend and backend are running:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend-nextjs
npm run dev
```

### 2. Be Specific with URLs
```
Good: "Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard"
Bad: "Go to the dashboard"
```

### 3. Request Screenshots
```
"Take a screenshot after clicking submit"
```

### 4. Combine with Database Checks
```
"Create a workspace and verify it exists in Supabase"
```

### 5. Iterative Testing
```
You: "Fill the signup form"
Claude: Fills form
You: "Now submit it"
Claude: Submits
You: "Take a screenshot"
Claude: Captures result
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Browser not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd frontend-nextjs
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Issue: "Cannot connect to localhost:3000"
