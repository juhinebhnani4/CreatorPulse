# How to Use Playwright MCP for E2E Testing

## Two Ways to Test with Playwright

---

## ‚úÖ Method 1: Through Claude Code (Recommended for Interactive Testing)

**You're already set up!** Just talk to Claude (me) in this conversation.

### How It Works

1. **Playwright MCP is already configured** in your Claude settings
2. **Just ask Claude to test something** - I'll use Playwright MCP automatically
3. **No code needed** - Just describe what you want to test

### Example Requests

#### Basic Navigation & Screenshots
```
"Navigate to localhost:3000 and take a screenshot"
```

```
"Go to the dashboard and show me what's there"
```

#### Test User Flows
```
"Test the login flow with email: test@example.com and password: testpass123"
```

```
"Test User Story 3.1 - Add RSS Feed Source"
```

```
"Walk through the complete newsletter generation flow"
```

#### Debug Issues
```
"Debug why the signup button isn't working"
```

```
"Take screenshots of each step in the content scraping process"
```

```
"Check if the workspace selector is visible after login"
```

#### Form Testing
```
"Fill out the registration form and submit it"
```

```
"Test form validation on the add source modal"
```

```
"Try to submit an empty newsletter form and verify error messages"
```

#### Database Verification
```
"Create a workspace and verify it exists in the database"
```

```
"Add a subscriber and check the subscribers table"
```

### What Happens When You Ask

When you say: **"Test the login flow"**

I will automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
2. ‚úÖ Fill in the email field
3. ‚úÖ Fill in the password field
4. ‚úÖ Click the sign in button
5. ‚úÖ Take screenshots at each step
6. ‚úÖ Verify you're redirected to dashboard
7. ‚úÖ Check database for session
8. ‚úÖ Report results back to you

### Before You Start

Make sure your servers are running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd e:\Career coaching\100x\scraper-scripts
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend-nextjs
npm run dev
```

Then just start asking me to test things!

## ‚úÖ Method 2: Run Existing Playwright Tests (Traditional Way)

Use this for running your pre-written test suites.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend-nextjs

# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific journey
npm run test:e2e:journey1    # User onboarding
npm run test:e2e:journey2    # Content sources
npm run test:e2e:journey3    # Newsletter generation

# Run with UI (visual mode)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Available Test Scripts

All scripts are in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
    "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
    "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
    "test:e2e:journey1": "playwright test journey-1-user-onboarding",
    "test:e2e:journey2": "playwright test journey-2-content-sources",
    "test:e2e:journey3": "playwright test journey-3-newsletter-generation",
    "test:e2e:report": "playwright show-report"
  }
}
```

### Existing Test Files

Your current E2E tests:
- `e2e/journey-1-user-onboarding.spec.ts` - Signup, login, workspace creation
- `e2e/journey-2-content-sources.spec.ts` - Add sources, scrape content
- `e2e/journey-3-newsletter-generation.spec.ts` - Generate, edit, send newsletter
- `e2e/debug-landing.spec.ts` - Debug test for landing page
- `e2e/journey-1-simple.spec.ts` - Simplified onboarding test

## üéØ Comparison: When to Use Each Method

| Task | Method 1 (Claude/MCP) | Method 2 (npm scripts) |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Quick exploratory testing** | ‚úÖ Best choice | ‚ùå Need to write code first |
| **Debug a specific issue** | ‚úÖ Best choice | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower |
| **Try out a new feature** | ‚úÖ Best choice | ‚ùå Need to write test |
| **Generate test code** | ‚úÖ Can generate for you | ‚ùå Manual coding |
| **Automated regression testing** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual each time | ‚úÖ Best choice |
| **CI/CD pipeline** | ‚ùå Not suitable | ‚úÖ Best choice |
| **Learning the app** | ‚úÖ Best choice | ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder |

## üí¨ Example Conversation with Claude

### You Say:
```
"I want to test the complete user registration flow"
```

### Claude Responds:
```
I'll test the user registration flow using Playwright MCP. Let me walk through it:

1. Navigating to localhost:3000...
2. Clicking "Sign Up" button...
3. Filling registration form...
4. Submitting...
5. Verifying redirect to dashboard...

‚úÖ Test Results:
- Registration form loads correctly
- Email validation works
- Password requirements enforced
- User successfully created in database
- Auto-login works
- Redirected to /app dashboard

üì∏ Screenshots saved to test-results/
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to localhost:3000"

**Solution:** Start your frontend dev server:
```bash
cd frontend-nextjs
npm run dev
```

### "Cannot connect to localhost:8000"

**Solution:** Start your backend server:
```bash
cd ..
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### "Element not found"

**Ask Claude:**
```
"Take a screenshot of the current page so we can see what's there"
```

### "Test is timing out"

**Ask Claude:**
```
"Wait for the page to fully load before clicking"
```

Or:
```
"Increase the timeout to 30 seconds"
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always start both servers before testing**
   - Backend on :8000
   - Frontend on :3000

2. **Be specific in your requests**
   - Good: "Test login with email test@example.com and password pass123"
   - Less good: "Test login"

3. **Ask for screenshots to debug**
   - "Take a screenshot after each step"
   - "Show me what the page looks like right now"

4. **Use user stories as a guide**
   - "Test User Story 3.1 from COMPLETE_USER_STORIES_E2E.md"

5. **Combine with database checks**
   - "Add a workspace and verify it's in the database"
