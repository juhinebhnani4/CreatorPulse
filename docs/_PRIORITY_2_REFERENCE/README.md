# Priority 2: Reference Documentation

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-22

## Purpose

Priority 2 files are **comprehensive reference guides** that provide deep dives into specific aspects of the CreatorPulse codebase. Read these when you need detailed understanding of a particular domain.

**When to Read**: After reading CLAUDE.md and Priority 1 Context files, when you need in-depth knowledge about:
- Frontend architecture and component patterns
- API endpoint specifications
- Database schema details
- Advanced configuration options

## Reading Strategy

### For Frontend Work
```
1. CLAUDE.md (Frontend section)
2. Priority 1: FRONTEND_BACKEND_MAPPING.md
3. Priority 2: FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md
4. Priority 2: SETTINGS_COMPONENTS.md (if working on Settings)
```

### For Full-Stack Feature Implementation
```
1. CLAUDE.md (Overview + Quick Reference)
2. Priority 1: TYPE_DEFINITIONS.md
3. Priority 1: FRONTEND_BACKEND_MAPPING.md
4. Priority 2: FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md
5. Priority 2: API_REFERENCE.md (when available)
```

### For Database Work
```
1. CLAUDE.md (Architecture section)
2. Priority 1: TYPE_DEFINITIONS.md
3. Priority 2: DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (when available)
```

### For Settings Page Work
```
1. CLAUDE.md (Frontend Pages Quick Reference)
2. Priority 2: FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md (Settings section)
3. Priority 2: SETTINGS_COMPONENTS.md (specific section you're working on)
```

## Navigation

- **Up**: [../README.md](../README.md) - Docs directory index
- **Sibling**: [../_PRIORITY_1_CONTEXT/](../_PRIORITY_1_CONTEXT/) - Essential context files
- **Root**: [../../CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - Primary context

---

## Maintenance

**Update Frequency**: When major architectural changes occur (e.g., new page added, Settings structure changed, major refactoring)

**Who Updates**: Developer making the architectural change should update corresponding reference doc

**Auto-Updates**: Not automated. Manual updates required for accuracy.

---

## Token Budget

- **FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md**: ~15,000 tokens
- **SETTINGS_COMPONENTS.md**: ~12,000 tokens
- **Total Priority 2 Docs**: ~27,000 tokens (when API_REFERENCE and DATABASE_SCHEMA added: ~50,000 tokens)

**Strategy**: Only read relevant Priority 2 docs based on task type. Don't read all at once.

---

## Notes

- Priority 2 docs are **reference materials**, not quick guides
- They provide the "why" and "how" behind architectural decisions
- When in doubt, check CLAUDE.md first for quick answers
- Use Priority 2 docs for deep understanding and complex implementations
