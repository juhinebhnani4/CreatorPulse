# âœ… FIXED: Ready to Run Tests!

## Issue Fixed

The `.env` file path has been fixed in `backend/config.py` to look in the parent directory where your `.env` file is located.

## Run Your First Test Now!

You already have the virtual environment activated (`.venv`), so just run:

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the backend directory
cd E:\Career coaching\100x\scraper-scripts\backend

# Run one simple test
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_auth_api.py::TestSignup::test_signup_validates_email_format -v
```

## Expected Output

You should see:
```
========================= test session starts ==========================
collected 1 item

tests/integration/test_auth_api.py::TestSignup::test_signup_validates_email_format PASSED [100%]

========================== 1 passed in 2.34s ===========================
```

## Run All Tests

Once the first test passes, run all tests:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

This will run all 35 tests and should take about 15-20 seconds.

## Run Specific Test Groups

```powershell
# Run only auth tests (15 tests)
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_auth_api.py -v

# Run only workspace tests (20 tests)
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_workspaces_api.py -v

# Run a specific test class
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_auth_api.py::TestSignup -v

# Run all signup tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_auth_api.py::TestSignup -v
```

## What Changed

**File**: `backend/config.py` line 14

**Before**: `env_file=".env"` (looked in backend directory)

**After**: `env_file="../.env"` (looks in parent directory where your .env is)

This allows the tests to find your Supabase credentials.

## Common Commands

```powershell
# Activate venv (if not already activated)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run tests
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with more details
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s

# Stop on first failure
python -m pytest tests/ -v -x

# Run tests matching a pattern
python -m pytest tests/ -v -k "signup"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting "No module named 'fastapi'"?

Your venv might not have backend dependencies. Install them:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tests are slow?

The first run might be slower as it connects to Supabase. Subsequent runs are faster.

### Tests fail with authentication errors?

Check that your `.env` file has valid Supabase credentials:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- `SECRET_KEY`

## Next Steps

Once tests pass:

1. âœ… **Celebrate!** You have a working test suite
2. âœ… **Bookmark this file** for future reference
3. âœ… **Run tests before committing** code changes
4. âœ… **Read the full docs** in [README.md](README.md) when you have time

## Full Test Suite

After your first test passes, you can explore:

- **15 Authentication tests**: User signup, login, token validation
- **20 Workspace tests**: CRUD operations, authorization, config management
- **Database verification**: Each test verifies data is saved to Supabase
- **Auto-cleanup**: Tests clean up after themselves automatically

**You're all set!** Just run the command above and watch your tests pass! ðŸš€
